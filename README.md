#### If this is your first time running it select module one. This will add 200 people to your friends list. 
#### To do this connect a cable to your android phone and make sure you have debugging mode enabled. Click [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options) for more on how to enable debugging mode on android.
#### Next open Vysor-win3.1.4.exe and click on view. This should show you your phone's screen on your computer.
#### Next open Snapchat on your phone and then follow the instructions on Snapify. 
#### Make sure that your mouse is on top of all the right places so it works perfectly. This will add people to your friends list.
#### This will take some time to do. Please don't interupt it as it may ruin the whole process on your account. The more time you leave it on the higher score you'll get.
#### Now that that's done you need to take a picture of anything on snapchat and you need to manually send it to everyone Snapify just added. This will take you a bit of time but it'll all be worth it at the end.
#### Now to make sure they got it take another picture and see if you have the Last Snap button like this:

#### Now that you have your phone set up go back to Snapify and select the second module. Type 'yes' when Snapify asks if you know how to use the tool or not. Then follow Snapify's inscrustions the same way you did in the first module. 
#### Now just sit back and enjoy your free snapscore boost.
